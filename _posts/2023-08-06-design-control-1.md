If you are an entrepreneur interested in establishing a company for software as a medical device, when should you start to implement a QMS system, especially design control?

The recommendation would be - **when you are ready to build your MVP** ([p.7](https://www.fda.gov/media/116762/download)).

- When you are out of the "ideation/research section" and enter the "design phase."
- When you pass your "prototype/proof-of-concept" beta version product and ready to build your MVP
- When you plan to bring your device to market (e.g., when there is a potential customer or you are going to distribute your product)
- And remember, before the first clinical use, unless you have an IRB-approved clinical trial.
  - If the clinical trial fulls into Investigation Device Exemption ([21 CFR 812](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-812)), you should also kick off your QMS and Design Control.

By that time, you should have
- your high-level intended use and instructions for use
  - This will tell you your Software Safety Classification (IEC 62304) and the regulatory paths, including the specifications required by the regulatory authorities and what type of validation you will need -- usability validation or plus clinical validation. This allows you to estimate better the timeline and resources required to set up your design control and QMS.
- vision your MVP-level [requirements](https://www.fda.gov/media/73141/download) including:
  - All software system inputs;
  - All software system outputs;
  - All functions that the software system will perform;
  - All performance requirements that the software will meet, (e.g., data throughput, reliability, and timing);
  - The definition of all external and user interfaces, as well as any internal software-to-system interfaces;
  - How users will interact with the system;
  - What constitutes an error and how errors should be handled;
  - Required response times;
  - The intended operating environment for the software, if this is a design constraint (e.g., hardware platform, operating system);
- Already know what software tools you will use in the design and development process. Due to the nature of software, the design and development process is also considered as the "production" process. So your software tools should be validated ([sec 6](https://www.fda.gov/media/73141/download) & [guidance](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/computer-software-assurance-production-and-quality-system-software)) before use.

Remember, for the EU, Canada, and some other countries - you will need your QMS certificate before/while you apply for your product's regulatory authorization. And it usually (of course, depending on your resources and the size of your company) takes 6 - 18 months for you to set us your QMS and technical files for your design-controlled product(s), and this is not including the administrative time you may encounter from the notified body and regulatory authorities sides.

I still recommend you have a whole QMS, although you are not obligated to have an entire QMS before the pre-market clearance for the US FDA, if you want to put it as your consensus standard in your pre-market submission. Not to mention that you still have to implement all the [design control](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-820/subpart-C/section-820.30) anyway.
