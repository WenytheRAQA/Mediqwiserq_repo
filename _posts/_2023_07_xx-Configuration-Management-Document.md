Just share notes and thoughts about the Software Maintenance and Software Configuration Management in IEC 62304 with you today (section 6 and 8 in 2015 version).

# Configuration Management

The "configuration management(CM)" is generic concept in ISO, IEC, and IEEE (or the [FDA Glossary](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/inspection-guides/glossary-computer-system-software-development-terminology-895)). It is applicable for hardware, software, and for product and service. 

Tailor it for IEC 62304, in my language, it means *your controls over your listed software items*  That includes 
- identification both the itme level and the system level
- Change Control Processes (map with ISO 13485:2016, ยง7.3.9)
- Configuration status accounting, aka records of the history, including when and why --- to ensure only authorized modifications will go into the product(s).

### Identifications

High-level deliverables:

**CM procedure**: describe the versioning system and the naming system:
- Versioning: Do you use major.minor.patch, major.minor.build.revion, or the year and date? And better to explain your definition of "major" and "minor."
  - Personally I prefer to have major and minor in the systemm, review the [FDA 510(k) software change guidnace](https://www.fda.gov/media/99785/download) or anything simliar from the regulatory authorities with the Engineering, and map the definition of "major" when we need to file a new submission.
- identifier: how do you name your software items.

**CM plan**:(62304, ยง5.1.9a.)

# Software Maintenance

# What do we need to do?

Actually, it is not really deviate from standard engineering practice (I hope).
