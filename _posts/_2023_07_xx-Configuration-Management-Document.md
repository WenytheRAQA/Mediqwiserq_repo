> One way a sponsor could address this documentation element of a premarket submission is to provide the recommended information on related software development, configuration management, and maintenance practices and procedures. In another approach, a sponsor could provide a Declaration of Conformity to specific clauses of the FDA-recognized version of ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304 Medical Device Software - Software Life Cycle Processes or the FDA- recognized version of IEC 62304 Medical device software - Software life cycle processes (hereafter referred to collectively as ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304). A sponsor could also provide a Declaration of Conformity to the complete ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304 standard. However, a Declaration of Conformity to the complete ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304 standard is not needed due to known differences in categorization of device software functions and other recommended documentation.
> A summary of the processes and procedures that are in place to manage the software life cycle development, software configuration and change management, and software maintenance activities should be provided. This summary information should include an adequate description of:
· Processes and procedures used in software development, verification, and validation.
· Software coding standards, methods, and tools used in software development.
· Main deliverables of the typical activities and tasks involved in software development, verification, and validation.
· Processes, procedures, and tools used to link user needs, system requirements, software requirements, software design specifications, software testing and implemented risk control measures (i.e., traceability).
· Processes and procedures used in software configuration and change management.
· Processes and procedures used in software maintenance that includes risk assessment of software changes, initial testing that evaluates the correctness of the implemented software change(s), and regression analysis and testing.
Alternatively, to address the recommendations for this documentation element, a sponsor may provide a Declaration of Conformity to the FDA-recognized version of ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304 Medical Device Software - Software Life Cycle Processes, including subclauses 5.1.1 (“Software development plan”), 5.1.2 (“Keep software development plan updated”), 5.1.3 (“Software development plan reference to system design and development”), 5.1.6 (“Software verification planning”), 5.1.7 (“Software risk management planning”), 5.1.8 (“Documentation planning”), 5.1.9 (“Software configuration management planning”), clause 6 (“Software maintenance process”), and clause 8 (“Software configuration management process”),54 among others as applicable.
> Documents implementing the configuration management and maintenance plans should be provided in addition to the summary documentation requested for the Basic Documentation Level, as described above.
Alternatively, to address the recommendations for this documentation element, a sponsor may provide a Declaration of Conformity to the FDA-recognized version of ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304 Medical Device Software – Software Life Cycle Processes, including subclause 5.1 (Software development planning), clause 6 (“Software maintenance process”), and clause 8 (“Software configuration management process”),55 among others as applicable.
